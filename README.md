The game comprises three distinct levels, each set within diverse biomes. With three lives at their disposal, the player must navigate through these levels. Exhausting all three lives results in the game's termination, necessitating the player to restart from the beginning. Additionally, collecting scattered coins throughout the maps is an optional task that players can engage in during their gameplay.
